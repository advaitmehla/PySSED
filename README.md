PySSED version 1.0 installation instructions.

PySSED should work out of the box using Python3 src/pyssed.py (see requirements.txt). However, if you need to add more filters, you will also need to download the model data files. Documentation, including detailed installation instructions, can be found in doc/Pyssed_manual.pdf.
